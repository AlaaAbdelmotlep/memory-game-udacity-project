How I built the Memory Game
I used the concept of Dom in js with HTML and some style from CSS
Created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is start or refresh
Created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
Added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
create a Congratulation modal when player wins game
